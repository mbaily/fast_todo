a pop-up tree-view for the node structure (lists and todos). can you implement one for html_no_js client? pop-up in the web pages. mobile friendly. scrollable up and down. You can use javascript. the name html_no_js isn't quite relevant anymore. also if you create endpoints make them JSON not form encoded. It should start the root node on the current page's todo or list and show all children but give the option to move upwards (to parents). You can expand or contract nodes as you explore.
