1. Implemented a test_pwa/ client in directory test_pwa/ which uses a python curses tui to explorer the usual data for a particular user, but using only the pwa related endpoints. It first thing it does is allow them to logon, then it syncs their whole data to the local app. 

2. The test_pwa allows the user to explore their data, and also to add new items, edit existing items, and delete items, whilst offline.

3. If the user is offline, the app will queue up any changes they make, and then when they go back online, it will sync those changes to the server.

4. The app will also periodically check for updates from the server, and if it finds any, it will sync those changes to the local app.

5. The app will also handle any conflicts that arise when syncing changes, by prompting the user to resolve them.

6. The app will also provide a way for the user to manually trigger a sync, in case they want to ensure that their changes are saved to the server immediately.

7. If you need to add or edit server endpoints related to pwa to accomplish these requirements, do so.

8. Use ruff to lint the code, and pytest to test the code.
